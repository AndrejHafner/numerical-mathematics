# Homework 4 - Simple pendulum

In the fourth homework we implemented a simple undampled pendulum. 
Its angle $\Theta(t)$ is defined with the differential equation
$$\frac{g}{l}sin(\Theta(t)) + \Theta''(t) = 0 $$
where $g$ is the acceleration due to Earth's gravity and $l$ is the length of the pendulum. 
The differential equation is solved using the method Runge-Kutta of the 4th order.

Below we show the pendulum swinging and show its angle and angular speed through time.
